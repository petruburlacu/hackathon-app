# 🚀 Hackathon User Workflow Analysis & Improvement Recommendations

## 📋 Current User Journey Analysis

### 1. **Authentication & Onboarding Flow**
**Current State:**
- User visits `localhost:3000` → sees splash page
- Clicks "Join Hackathon" → redirected to `/signin`
- Signs up with email/password → redirected to hackathon profile setup
- Completes profile (role selection + optional company email) → enters hackathon

**Issues Identified:**
- ❌ No clear explanation of what happens after signup
- ❌ Profile setup feels disconnected from main flow
- ❌ No preview of hackathon features before joining
- ❌ Company email field is optional but unclear why it's needed

### 2. **Main Dashboard Experience**
**Current State:**

- Navigation bar with all sections
- Quick action buttons

**Issues Identified:**

### 4. **Teams Workflow**
**Current State:**

- ❌ No team search or filtering
- ❌ Team idea assignment requires navigation to ideas page
- ❌ Status updates are manual and unclear
- ❌ No team member management (kick members, etc.)

### 5. **Navigation & UX Issues**
**Current State:**

- User menu with theme toggle and sign out

**Issues Identified:**
- ❌ Navigation is too cluttered
